# jskel

Debut is a collection of my startup files, scripts, and basic configuration
files. Setup is intended to be as generic as possible across the range of
systems and users which I commonly use.

Fitness for anyone else is purely coincidental.

## Installation

```bash
make install
```

Overwritten files will be backed up as <filename>~YYMMDDHHmmSS
