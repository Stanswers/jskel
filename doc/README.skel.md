# Skel

All my bash skeleton files.

### bash_aliases

A collection of bash functions, simple shell completion, and aliases to make
life just a little bit easier.

### bash_completion.maven

Bash completion for maven is provided by
<https://github.com/juven/maven-bash-completion>

### bash_logout

Simply clears the console on logout for privacy.

### bash_profile

Just sources `~/.bashrc` and iteratively appends directories to the `$PATH`
environmental variable if the directory exists.

### bashrc

My `~/.bashrc` file. Sources the system `/etc/bashrc`,
`~/.bash_completion.maven`, `~/.bash_aliases`, and other shell files.  Sets up
environment variables.

### inputrc

Just some inputrc...
